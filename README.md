# **WASM-Plugin**

---

This is a small reference implementation for a WASM script runner that can be modified to be put into any rust program.

This implementation uses a rust source file to compile a script in a temporary directory

**Note**

You must have `wasm32-unknown-unknown` installed with rustup for the script compilation process to work
